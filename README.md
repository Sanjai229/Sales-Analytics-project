## Retail Sales Analytics & Forecasting
## Project Overview

This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover sales trends, category-wise performance, regional insights, and the impact of discounting on profitability. A sales forecasting model was developed to predict future sales trends and support data-driven business decisions.

## Business Objectives

* Identify sales and profit trends over time

* Analyze category-wise and region-wise performance

* Understand the impact of discounts on profitability

* Forecast future sales to aid planning and inventory management

## Dataset

* Superstore Retail Sales Dataset

* Contains order-level data including sales, profit, discount, category, region, and order dates

## Tools & Technologies

* Python

* Pandas, NumPy

* Matplotlib, Seaborn

* Scikit-learn

* Git & GitHub

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights from EDA:

* Sales show a consistent upward trend with seasonal fluctuations

* Technology is the most profitable category

* Furniture has high sales but very low profit margins

* Higher discounts are strongly associated with negative profits

* Regional performance varies significantly

## Sales Forecasting

* Aggregated monthly sales data

* Built a Linear Regression model to forecast future sales

## Evaluation metrics:

* RMSE

* R² score
  
## Key Takeaways

* Revenue alone is not a measure of success - profitability matters

* Discount strategies must be optimized to prevent losses

* Forecasting enables proactive planning and decision-making

## Future Improvements

* Implement ARIMA / Prophet for better forecasting

* Add interactive dashboards (Power BI / Tableau)

* Perform customer segmentation for targeted marketing strategies
